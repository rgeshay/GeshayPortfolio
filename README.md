# What I Hope To Learn
I'm taking Telling Stories with Data to further refine my visual skills and tailor them towards conveying information for specific audiences. My future career in consulting will necessitate not only coneying information clearly, but purposefully - for both clients and clients' clients. Aside from professional applications, I'm also just quite a visual person. I trust in my expertise when evaluating visual content and want to further cultivate this in data applications.
