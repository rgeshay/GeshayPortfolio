## What I Hope To Learn
I'm taking Telling Stories with Data to further refine my visual skills and tailor them towards conveying information for specific audiences. My future career in consulting will necessitate not only coneying information clearly, but purposefully - for both clients and clients' clients. Gaining literacy with the applications and coding languages that support this sort of work is also quite valuable to me - this is my first time using Github! Look at that, another skill I'm developing! Wow!
\
\
I'm also just quite a visual learner, so I know what does and doesn't work for me personally. My love of art informas my expertise when evaluating visual content, but now I want to apply my skills towards data visuals creation while also finding and fixing what I'm not good at! We'll see how this goes :)

[Assignments 3&4: Critique By Design](https://rgeshay.github.io/GeshayPortfolio/assignments3_4.html)
\
This assignment focuses on evaluating and improving an [existing data visualization from the Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2015/11/05/2-public-support-for-action-on-climate-change/climate-change-report-41/). The overall redesign process includes analyzing the current data visualization, evaluating what is and is not successful, brainstorming different graphical representations, and then alternating between redesign and peer review. The final visualization represents the culmination of this process. The original Pew Research Center visualization was chosen because it lacked sophisticated design, the trends in the data was not clear, and because its story was compelling despite its visual appearance. Understanding that despite climate skepticism, climate policy is desired across the globe is very interesting and almost counterintuitive. By having the data reflect this surprising finding in a more polished, dramatic way, the story can be more clearly understood. The data is composed of response metrics from national surveys, one topic of which was climate change.
