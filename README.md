# What I Hope To Learn
I'm taking Telling Stories with Data to further refine my visual skills and tailor them towards conveying information for specific audiences. My future career in consulting will necessitate not only coneying information clearly, but purposefully - for both clients and clients' clients. Gaining literacy with the applications and coding languages that support this sort of work is also quite valuable to me - this is my first time using Github! Look at that, another skill I'm developing! Wow!
\
\
I'm also just quite a visual learner, so I know what does and doesn't work for me personally. My love of art informas my expertise when evaluating visual content, but now I want to apply my skills towards data visuals creation while also finding and fixing what I'm not good at! We'll see how this goes :)

# Debt-to-GDP Trends (1995-2021)
This visualization displays the Debt to GDP ratio for many different countries. Using available data from 1995 to 2021, looking at these charts side by side allow for macro-level trend comparisons.

# North America Debt-to-GDP Trends Largely Over Global Average
Zooming in on North America specifically, data spikes occur due to the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic in all three countries. The richest countries (USA and CAN) lie far above the global average, but all three show decreasing debt in the "post-pandemic" world.
