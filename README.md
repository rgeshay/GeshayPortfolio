# What I Hope To Learn
I'm taking Telling Stories with Data to further refine my visual skills and tailor them towards conveying information for specific audiences. My future career in consulting will necessitate not only coneying information clearly, but purposefully - for both clients and clients' clients. Gaining literacy with the applications and coding languages that support this sort of work is also quite valuable to me - this is my first time using Github! Look at that, another skill I'm developing! Wow!
\
\
I'm also just quite a visual learner, so I know what does and doesn't work for me personally. My love of art informas my expertise when evaluating visual content, but now I want to apply my skills towards data visuals creation while also finding and fixing what I'm not good at! We'll see how this goes :)
