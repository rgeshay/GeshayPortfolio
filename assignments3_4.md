# Assignment 3&4: Critique By Design
\
**Step 1: Find a data visualization you can improve**
\
\
The below chart is from the Pew Research Center. It details climate change opinions at the national scale. At first glance, a few issues are immediately obvious to me: the title isn't informattive/narrative enough, the data does not look to be organized in any particular way, and the colors are dull. Though this visualization is not terrible, it can definitely be improved.

**Step 2: Critique the Data Visualization**
\
\
Using Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) as a guideline, the next step in this critique involves focusing on specific visualization aspects and identifying areas of improvement. The following survey demonstrates this analytical process.

\
**Step 3: Sketch Out a Solution**
\
\
After considering the changes that need to be prioritized (improve readability, choose visualization tool tha is not a vertical bar chart, color scheme), I then brainstormed different ways to display this data.
\
\
Sketch 1: Horizontal Bar Chart
\

\
I first considered simply rotating the bar chart and sorting the data by size. This visualization solves the issue of the original visualization not fitting on the screen at the same time and improves readability. I also reduced the concept down to a single color to emphasize supporting climate legislation more than climate skepticism. However, this graph did not feel creative enough to me. I wanted to better emphasize the disparity between each country's percentages to make the story more impactful. I want to convey that even though people are skeptical about climate change, they still support climate legislation. The bar graph doesn't make this visually dramatic enough, so I sketched out my next idea.
\
\
Sketch 2: Scatterplot
\

\
I next considered using a scatterplot. The visual trend in the data is more easy to see with this type of visualization, which I like. Unfortunately, I think it's inefficient to have two axes with the same units (e.g. percentage). This method also requires labeling every data point, which is too cluttered for my taste. Finally, I didn't know how to introduce color to this visualization in a way that adds significant meaning or interpretation to the data. This visualization does not look bad, but it's not as strong as I want it to be. Thus...

Sketch 3:

\
After the previous two sketches, I considered using a map to tell my data story. I was excited to try this because I know Tableau has robust visualizations utilizing maps. Sadly, I could not find the dataset itself that has 37 data points, which I think would be more effective on a global map than the 15 data points I gleaned directly from the original visualization. I was also worried about how I would input the data itself onto the map - so much so that I didn't even add it to the map I traced. I considered 3D bar graphs (too complicated), ratios of one percentage to another (too hard to conceptualize for the audience), and just reporting the percentages over their gived countries (too simple, not strategic).
