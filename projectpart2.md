# Final Project: Part 2

For this phase of the final project, my goal is to create a story wireframe that clearly outlines the main parts of my narrative. The feedback from part 1 highlighted the need to narrow my scope for narrative strength, and visualize more of my statistics. Because of this, I've come up with the following:

## Section 1: Visualizing Hook Statistic

From my plan in Part 1, I had planned to hook my audience through the use of a shocking statistic: 3.4 million people will die per year from climate change by 2100 ([Source: V20](https://www.v-20.org/new-health-data-shows-unabated-climate-change-will-cause-3.4-million-deaths-per-year-by-century-end#:~:text=The%20Health%20Data%20Explorer%20outlines,million%20deaths%20would%20be%20avoided.)). This statistic is impactful, but could be further strengthed by visualizing what this actually means in a practical sense. One of the first visualizations we looked at in this class aimed to spatially represent wealth inequality because people have a hard time properly conceptualzing billions of dollars. Considering this, creating a graphic to help put 3.4 million people into perspective becomes necessary.

To isualize this, I tried to find data that would help put this into a spatially understandable perspective. My first thought was to continue using people as units, and this made me immediately think of city populations. Looking up populations in the U.S., I found 2020 population data on both LA and Chicago, between which the 3.4 million statistics falls in the middle. By using thee two big cities as a reference, I can more clearly illustrate the scale of climate-related deaths.

I made the following graphic to combine with the above statistic. It is displayed as a screenshot because the text is edited to show up on a dark background:

I chose a bar graph because it most clearly represented 3 numbers. I conaidered using 3 side-by-side circles, but it was less clear than the bars. I used the color green to highlight the climate death statistic instead of one of the city populations because I couldn't decide which one was stronger (the global death stat reaching nearly the size of LA, or over the size of Chicago). I think this was more clear, because the other highlights in this section all have to do with death rates as well.

## Section 2: Adding Global Context

To further establish where my scope will be going, I first want to strengthen the foundation of the global side of my argument. To do this, I used an image from [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/world/europe/climate-change-germany-flooding.html) to transition into talking about global climate vulnerability disparities. This transition is immediately followed by a map I made in Flourish using [Notre Dame's GAIN Index data](https://gain.nd.edu/our-work/country-index/rankings/).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12818790"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

I chose a green-red color scheme to match my other highlighting colors. Once we transition away from talking about death and global vulnerabilities, I may switch to a different highlighting color to help shift the tone. I know that this color scheme is not currently color-blind friendly, so I may change it. I also want to follow this graphic with a table or list of the 5 or 10 most climate-vulnerable countries. This will enable me to smoothly focus on issues relating to the global south, which may be the best way to narrow my scope.

## Section 3: Focusing on Women

Here I want to maintain the global focus, but narrow who is being considered in this global context. By focusing on women specifically, I am able to tell a more compelling narrative than just "the world is on fire and we're all doomed," as this is both terrible an unoriginal. I use [this image](https://www.globalwaters.org/women-water-alliance/women-water-alliance-all-resources) to transition into the topic, pulling focus on women and showing faces to increase my story's emotional appeal.

I moved forward my statistic on 80% of those displaced by climate change are women from the [United Nations](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/06/1121442). In my original plan it came after my dot plots, but I moved it forward since I think it helps ease the viewer into the context of focusing on women.

I made this infographic to visually display the information:

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="1d439dbc-aece-45b6-a3bb-22cfaf824afe" data-type="interactive" data-title="Ocean Sand"></div><script>!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/1d439dbc-aece-45b6-a3bb-22cfaf824afe" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Ocean Sand</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

Next comes focusing inon a specific women's climate issue.

I originally planned to make two side-by-side dot plots of mortality rates by gender due to unsafe water and air quality. When converted into dot plots, the data was too difficult to read and not dramatic enough. I eventually created dot plots separated by gender, then cleaned the cluttered data by focusing on regions insead of individual countries. The dots alone were still not clear enough, so I overlayed the variables with box-plots. This created stronger clarity and made the data a bit more dramatic, but was still not quite as dramatic as I'd originally envisioned. Perhaps I could fix this by zooming in on a single country that has a particularly high mortality rate, but this feels too much like cherry-picking data.

Here is the water quality visualization I made:

<iframe src='https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/12826942/embed' title='Interactive or visual content' class='flourish-embed-iframe' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' style='width:100%;height:600px;' sandbox='allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation'></iframe><div style='width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;'><a class='flourish-credit' href='https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/12826942/?utm_source=embed&utm_campaign=visualisation/12826942' target='_top' style='text-decoration:none!important'><img alt='Made with Flourish' src='https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg' style='width:105px!important;height:16px!important;border:none!important;margin:0!important;'> </a></div>

I had a second data set from the same source that yields relative mortality from air pollution along gender lines. After formatting that data to match the visualization above, I found that the data did not support my hypothesis. When I tried displaying country-level data is was too complex, but when I tried using regions (as with the visualization above) I found that men actually die more on average from air pollution. This is unfortunate in that I cannot execute my original vision while staying true to the data, but is FANTASTIC news when cosnidering the still wide scope of my project. This will enable me to focus on women's access to water as an issue.
