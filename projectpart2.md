# Final Project: Part 2

For this phase of the final project, my goal is to create a story wireframe that clearly outlines the main parts of my narrative. The feedback from part 1 highlighted the need to narrow my scope for narrative strength, and visualize more of my statistics. Because of this, I've come up with the following:

## Detailed Project Outline (aka "Wireframe")

### Section 1: Visualizing Hook Statistic

From my plan in Part 1, I had planned to hook my audience through the use of a shocking statistic: 3.4 million people will die per year from climate change by 2100 ([Source: V20](https://www.v-20.org/new-health-data-shows-unabated-climate-change-will-cause-3.4-million-deaths-per-year-by-century-end#:~:text=The%20Health%20Data%20Explorer%20outlines,million%20deaths%20would%20be%20avoided.)). This statistic is impactful, but could be further strengthed by visualizing what this actually means in a practical sense. One of the first visualizations we looked at in this class aimed to spatially represent wealth inequality because people have a hard time properly conceptualzing billions of dollars. Considering this, creating a graphic to help put 3.4 million people into perspective becomes necessary.

To visualize this, I tried to find data that would help put this into a spatially understandable perspective. My first thought was to continue using people as units, and this made me immediately think of city populations. Looking up populations in the U.S., I found 2020 population data on both LA and Chicago, between which the 3.4 million statistics falls in the middle. By using thee two big cities as a reference, I can more clearly illustrate the scale of climate-related deaths.

I made the following graphic to combine with the above statistic. It is displayed as a screenshot because the text is edited to show up on a dark background:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123282392/220430662-e75aa2e9-c8cf-4689-82c0-cfe52971f63c.png)


I chose a bar graph because it most clearly represented 3 numbers. I conaidered using 3 side-by-side circles, but it was less clear than the bars. I used the color green to highlight the climate death statistic instead of one of the city populations because I couldn't decide which one was stronger (the global death stat reaching nearly the size of LA, or over the size of Chicago). I think this was more clear, because the other highlights in this section all have to do with death rates as well.

### Section 2: Adding Global Context

To further establish where my scope will be going, I first want to strengthen the foundation of the global side of my argument. To do this, I used an image from [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/world/europe/climate-change-germany-flooding.html) to transition into talking about global climate vulnerability disparities. This transition is immediately followed by a map I made in Flourish using [Notre Dame's GAIN Index data](https://gain.nd.edu/our-work/country-index/rankings/).

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12818790"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

I chose a green-red color scheme to match my other highlighting colors. Once we transition away from talking about death and global vulnerabilities, I may switch to a different highlighting color to help shift the tone. I know that this color scheme is not currently color-blind friendly, so I may change it. I also want to follow this graphic with a table or list of the 5 or 10 most climate-vulnerable countries. This will enable me to smoothly focus on issues relating to the global south, which may be the best way to narrow my scope.

### Section 3: Focusing on Women

Here I want to maintain the global focus, but narrow who is being considered in this global context. By focusing on women specifically, I am able to tell a more compelling narrative than just "the world is on fire and we're all doomed," as this is both terrible an unoriginal. I use [this image](https://www.globalwaters.org/women-water-alliance/women-water-alliance-all-resources) to transition into the topic, pulling focus on women and showing faces to increase my story's emotional appeal.

I moved forward my statistic on 80% of those displaced by climate change are women from the [United Nations](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/06/1121442). In my original plan it came after my dot plots, but I moved it forward since I think it helps ease the viewer into the context of focusing on women.

I made this animated infographic to visually display the information:

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="1d439dbc-aece-45b6-a3bb-22cfaf824afe" data-type="interactive" data-title="Ocean Sand"></div><script>!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/1d439dbc-aece-45b6-a3bb-22cfaf824afe" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Ocean Sand</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

Next comes focusing in on a specific women's climate issue.

I originally planned to make two side-by-side dot plots of mortality rates by gender due to unsafe water and air quality. When converted into dot plots, the data was too difficult to read and not dramatic enough. I eventually created dot plots separated by gender, then cleaned the cluttered data by focusing on regions insead of individual countries. The dots alone were still not clear enough, so I overlayed the variables with box-plots. This created stronger clarity and made the data a bit more dramatic, but was still not quite as dramatic as I'd originally envisioned. Perhaps I could fix this by zooming in on a single country that has a particularly high mortality rate, but this feels too much like cherry-picking data.

Here is the water quality visualization I made:

<iframe src='https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/12826942/embed' title='Interactive or visual content' class='flourish-embed-iframe' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' style='width:100%;height:600px;' sandbox='allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation'></iframe><div style='width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;'><a class='flourish-credit' href='https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/12826942/?utm_source=embed&utm_campaign=visualisation/12826942' target='_top' style='text-decoration:none!important'><img alt='Made with Flourish' src='https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg' style='width:105px!important;height:16px!important;border:none!important;margin:0!important;'> </a></div>

I had a second data set from the same source that yields relative mortality from air pollution along gender lines. After formatting that data to match the visualization above, I found that the data did not support my hypothesis. When I tried displaying country-level data is was too complex, but when I tried using regions (as with the visualization above) I found that men actually die more on average from air pollution. This is unfortunate in that I cannot execute my original vision while staying true to the data, but is FANTASTIC news when considering the still wide scope of my project. This will enable me to focus on women's access to water as an issue.

### Section 4: Women and Climate Disasters in the Global South

I think this is the direction my project will go in, and I plan to hone this between now and the final submission.

Depending on my interview feedback, I may move the previous boxplot graphic to this section. Regardless, I need to plan out maybe one or two more visualizations that strengthen this specific narrative. I plan to focus in from the global scale to the GLobal South specifically, which will both help narrow my narrative scope and give me a clearer picture of who exactly my audience is. This makes sense to me, but I'll have to use the peer interviews to ensure this fits with my existing visuals.

I found a new data source that inspired me to make this new section on cliamte disasters. I found some information that "Cyclone Gorky, which hit Bangladesh in 1991, caused around 140,000 deaths. The disparity between genders in terms of survival from this event was approximately 14:1... Similarly, in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, 70 percent of the 250,000 fatalities were women" (Source: [this article](https://www.brinknews.com/gender-and-disasters/), which cites [a report from the World Bank](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/723731468234284901/making-womens-voices-count-integrating-gender-issues-in-disaster-risk-management-overview-and-resources-for-guidance-notes)). This is both horrifying and strengthens the narrative established by my map of countries most vulnerable to climate change.

I decided to depict the above data through pie charts and text boxes. I want to showcase a variety of data visualization techniques, so I do not want to rely on yet another infographic of small people icons to represent my data. I want to include both percentages and whole numbers, and I can't think of another way to clearly showcase both data types. I was having some trouble animating my graphics the way I wanted by embedding them, so I'm still working out how best to integrate these charts into the final piece. For now, they are a series of static images. I will make them easier to differentiate by having the two images for the first disaster right-aligned and the two pictures for the second disaster left-aligned. 

The complete images of both titles and pie charts are below:

### Section 5: What's currently being done

I got this idea while finalizing another graphic, but I will building this section out between now and the final presentation. I want a section about what's currently being done to address this issue of climate-gender bias to help lighten the tone and inspire the audience to act. I don't want the page to end as abruptly as it currently does. I plan to make another 3 or so visualizations to put in this section and heavily rely on pictures to further lighten the tone. One will probably be a visual depiction of a statistic, but I want another one to be on dollars or number of people being supported by some current efforts, and any changes over time that may have been documented. I will do this data research later.



### Section 6: Call to Action

I want this section to have pictures with captions for organizations, then link both the pictures and text


### Next Steps

I need to ensure that my color scheme is cohesive. In some places the shades of green do not match the shades of green-blue, so I'd like to choose one of those to stick to. Perhaps I'll use one color per section, but stick within a specific color palette. I also want to get rid of the red as a highlighting color because I think it's too intense and adds too much negativity to an already heavy topic, so I might switch to yellow to compliment the green-blue I use.

I will also have to incorporate a sections for the bibliography supported by maintain in-text citations.

I want to add a long section near the end that addresses current actions that are being done to address the problem of climate gender bias in the global south, as detaile din the above Section 6.


### My final outline can be found [here in Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/women-climate-threats/index.html)


## User Research Protocol: Target Audience

For this project, I want the audience of my story to be moderately educated Western people. I think that narrowing in my scope to the Global South will be very effective with this group. This would also allow me to further refine my call to action with specific organizations that can be donated to. I don't want hte story to be overly negative, so I need to add a long section about positive actions that are currently being done to address this climate-gender bias.

## User Research Protocol: Interviews and Feedback

### Who the interviewers are

I interviewed three of my peers for feedback on my outline, visuals, and data graphics. The first two were female students and the third is male, and all three are in their 2nd years at Heinz.

The first person I interviewed has visual design experience and an undergraduate major in English. These factors make her an effective resource for judging the flow of a narrative through both text and visual design. The second person I interviewed is more technically literate and was better able to dissect the data visuals themselves. The third person participates in online data visualization communities for fun, so I think that his opinion might have been the most valuable for the visualizations themselves, but he may be a bit weak in the other visual design elements of my outline.

In my interviews, I wanted the conversation to flow organically. I had the reviewers scroll through my storyboad and narrate their thoughts, but I also asked a series of leading questions along the way.

| Questions | Participant 1 |  |  Participant 2  |  Participant 3  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Does the main title tell a story  | Yes, I think it's effective  |  It could be more precise, but ti works well with the background image  |  Make it more specific  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

 the target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified. 


Maggie:
title slide: Likes starting picture
red as a highlighting color is good
doesn't like the diverging into 2 columns, wants it all in one column
change bar highlight to red to match title
add photo of LA crowd, aerial shot, LA at night
add timescale to graphic
map colors are easy to understand, title is narrative enough; change scaling of map, subtitle is too wordy, convert subtitle into a text paragraph
scatterplot: easy to understand cuz of colors and title, thinks title could be shorter/more direct
transition: red text is hard to read, add a transparent filter over the picture so it's easier to read; move scatterplot into next section instead, add narrative textbox to map
icon infographic: likes it and the animation
boxplots: make the visualization distinction more obvious, try using a different visualization like a map with highlights for the countries that are above the mean specifically, which could add to a narrative about the global south; the strength of this data is in WHERE the mortality means are geographically
pie charts: effective
thinks audience is Western audience that can donate to causes
main takeaways: narrow scope to either water issues/scarcity, or adjust scope to global south specifically (matches images), narrow scope early on in narrative

Aishwarya:
title slide - good first impression, better/more informative title (part of why I need to narrow my scope)
section 2: goes from bright to dark very suddenly, considering keeping title image behind text box, bar chart title is a bit condusing/doesn't add enough context, takes too long to understand its main point, green color is no good, consider highlighting the data better (icon, color, etc.), consider using yellow as a highlighting color or a transluscent textbox
likes transition slides moving into maps
map: title and colors make meaning very clear; make legend smaller or map itself bigger
likes variety of visuals (pics, graphics, etc.)
scatterplot: title is a little confusing
transition: words are difficult to read
likes inforgraphic with icons: very easy to understand, easy to read, good use of highlighting; add more teal space between text and transition image
boxplots: likes it, thinks the difference between men and women could be more highlighted, amend title to be more general and then verbalize "women have it rough buddy", (hehe thinks the difference isn't big enough to justify grandiose claims of gender disparities, get over yourself)
pie charts: fix pictures lol, make titles bigger, stick to one highlighting color
