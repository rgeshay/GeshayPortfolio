# Final Project: Part 2

For this phase of the final project, my goal is to create a story wireframe that clearly outlines the main parts of my narrative. The feedback from part 1 highlighted the need to narrow my scope for narrative strength, and visualize more of my statistics. Because of this, I've come up with the following:

## Visualizing Hook Statistic

From my plan in Part 1, I had planned to hook my audience through the use of a shocking statistic: 3.4 million people will die per year from climate change by 2100 ([Source: V20](https://www.v-20.org/new-health-data-shows-unabated-climate-change-will-cause-3.4-million-deaths-per-year-by-century-end#:~:text=The%20Health%20Data%20Explorer%20outlines,million%20deaths%20would%20be%20avoided.)). This statistic is impactful, but could be further strengthed by visualizing what this actually means in a practical sense. One of the first visualizations we looked at in this class aimed to spatially represent wealth inequality because people have a hard time properly conceptualzing billions of dollars. Considering this, creating a graphic to help put 3.4 million people into perspective becomes necessary.

To isualize this, I tried to find data that would help put this into a spatially understandable perspective. My first thought was to continue using people as units, and this made me immediately think of city populations. Looking up populations in the U.S., I found 2020 population data on both LA and Chicago, between which the 3.4 million statistics falls in the middle. By using thee two big cities as a reference, I can more clearly illustrate the scale of climate-related deaths.

I made the following graphic to combine with the above statistic:

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="ac010214-b54a-4580-8a3c-7582fd4b1f63" data-type="interactive" data-title="Climate Deaths &amp;amp; Populations"></div><script>!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/ac010214-b54a-4580-8a3c-7582fd4b1f63" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Climate Deaths & Populations</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

I chose a bar graph because it most clearly represented 3 numbers. I conaidered using 3 side-by-side circles, but it was less clear than the bars. I used the color green to highlight the climate death statistic instead of one of the city populations because I couldn't decide which one was stronger (the global death stat reaching nearly the size of LA, or over the size of Chicago). I think this was more clear, because the other highlights in this section all have to do with death rates as well.
