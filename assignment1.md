The above visualization displays the Debt-to-GDP ratio for many different countries. Using available data from 1995 to 2021, looking at these charts side by side allow for macro-level trend comparisons. Generally, there is an observable increase over time, implying that governments are taking on more debt relative to their GDP is able to grow. n some countries like Canada and Luxembourg, there is an observable spike in the most recent data. This is de to the Covid-19 pandemic, which required investment to combat while hurting economies. Naturally, in this time debt increased while GDP either decreased or remained relatively constant.

Theese different visualization methods serve different purposes inherently. The first chart had debt ratios explored in a single year, taking out the temporal scale of the data and focusing on comparing the debt-to-GDP ratios of different countries. This is easy to observe because the information is contained in a single chart.

The next visualization uses the gridline of charts method to compare individual countries' trends over time. The data spans 1995-2021 when available. This visualization is a little more difficult to comprehend because there are so many lines, but once the viewer understands what's going on it becomes easier to glean information. In order to make this visualization my own, I tried to use dotted guiding gridlines instead of solid ones, but this effect looks much better in Flourish than it does translated into GitHub. I also attempted to add a Y-axis label, but Flourish insisted on repeating this label for every row of line charts, which looked far too cluttered and redundant.
