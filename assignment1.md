# Debt-to-GDP Trends (1995-2021)
This visualization displays the Debt-to-GDP ratio for many different countries. Using available data from 1995 to 2021, looking at these charts side by side allow for macro-level trend comparisons. Generally, there is an observable spike during the "peak pandemic" years of 2020-2021, in which government debt increased faster than GDP did during the same years. In the "post pandemic" world, we can observe this trend generally declining, implying that debt is being paid off manageably.

# North America Debt-to-GDP Trends Largely Over Global Average
Zooming in on North America specifically, data spikes occur due to the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic in all three countries. The richest countries (USA and CAN) lie far above the global average, implying that within their ratio of debt-to-GDP, their debt is increasing faster than their GDP. All three show decreasing debt in the "post-pandemic" world.
