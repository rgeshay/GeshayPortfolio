# Final Project: Part 3

This page describes the finishing touches I put on my final project for this course.

## Differences from Part 2 Planning

During Part 2 Planning, I made a variety of decisions that were ultimately thrown out. Creative formatting and visual design aesthetic decided a lot of my graphics decisions.

### Copyright-free Images

A major change I had to make between Part 2/the in-class presentation and my final submission was the use of copyright-free images. I had originally cited my images as sources, but took them out per the assignment guidelines (which I had somehow previously overlooked). The new images still tell a compelling story while also being very high resolution. I tried to maintain the use of people-first images to help underscore the people-first narrative that I am trying to tell. For those images of natural scenery, I tried to choose images with muted colors so as not to distract from the human elements of other visuals.

### Use of Color

For the in0class presentation, I had more of my color choices finalized. After seeing my website up on the big screen, I realized that some of my color choices were not strategic enough. I leaned more heavily on the red that  used in the beginning of my presentation to delineate the sections on providing global and gender context. I then made a point of color coordinationg the natural disaster section a teal color and the water quality/scarcity section a light blue. I used these colors in section headers, visualizations, and as highlighting colors in large bodies of text. I also used these colors int he final call to action section. Increasing their use is more effective at helping the audience differentiate between the two topics.

### Audience Refinement

In Part 2 I was still slightly confused as to who exactly my audience would be. I had decided that it was a Western/Global North audience that needed to increase their awareness on the Global North-South climate and gender divide. However, as I worked I began to write my text to explain the datasets and articles that I had read. This inadvertently helped me focus on the US student population in Global North countries. Once I actively realized this, I was able to give further context on this complex intersection of issues such that a student with no context could read through the page and still understand what I was talking about. This is also why I chose Los Angeles and Chicago as my population comparisons in the hook of my website, choosing to focus on US cities with which youth would likely be familiar.

### New Visualizations

In addition to the Part 2 visualizations I had already made (the populations and mortality rate bar chart, the ND GAIN world map, the 80% statistic infographic, the natural disaster pie charts, the water quality boxplot), I decided to create a few more data visualizations. I did not realize the gaps in my logic until I was designing them within Shorthand. To fill in these gaps, I made the following visualizations:

#### Pie Chart Refinement
I recreated my Infogram pie chart sin Flourish so that they could be animated.

#### Global Carbon Emissions
Previously, I felt as if the fact that the Global South is bearing the climate change burden despite not contributing much to global carbon emissions was not obvious enough. To draw more direct focus to this topic, I decided to make a new graphic that would illustrate this point. I made the graphic a map so that it could easily be compared agains tht eprevious map, which is also why I put them relatively close together. I originally thought of putting them side-by-side so that they could be even more easily compared, but this did not allow of the text I wanted associated with each graphic to be visible at the same time. Ultimately, I wanted the text association more than the side-by-side map association.

#### Linking Climate and Gender

Similar tot he above new graphic, I decided that burying my argument inside text was not as compelling as crafting a visualization. To this end, I made a scatterplot correlating cmlimate vulnerability with gender inequity, helping to uderscore that these two concepts are closely intertwined. I used blue because that is the main color pallete of my shorthand page; I decided against red because it seemed a feww steps ahead of the rest of the context section, which is red-coded.
