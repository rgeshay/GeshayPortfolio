# Final Project: Part 3

This page describes the finishing touches I put on my final project for this course.

The final Shirthand website can be viewed [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/women-climate-threats/index.html).

## Differences from Part 2 Planning

During Part 2 Planning, I made a variety of decisions that were ultimately thrown out. Creative formatting and visual design aesthetic decided a lot of my graphics decisions.

### Quote as New Hook

Though the mortality statistic is shocking, I wanted a better way of establishing the people-first narrative that I was trying to go for. To this end, I decided that a quote was the best way to start off the website after the initial title section. THe quote I chose was from a notable women worker in this field of gender equity through a climate lens, and the content of her quote underscores the exact main message connecting climate and gender. This quote is also a strategic choice; as the first content that the audence is exposed to, it is kept in the back of their mind thorughout their experience on the webpage. This further supports the agrument I make throughout, that issues of gender and the environment are inherently intertwined in the Global South.

### Copyright-free Images

A major change I had to make between Part 2 the in-class presentation and my final submission was the use of copyright-free images. I had originally cited my images as sources, but took them out per the assignment guidelines (which I had somehow previously overlooked). The new images still tell a compelling story while also being very high resolution. I tried to maintain the use of people-first images to help underscore the people-first narrative that I am trying to tell. For those images of natural scenery, I tried to choose images with muted colors so as not to distract from the human elements of other visuals.

### Use of Color

For the in0class presentation, I had more of my color choices finalized. After seeing my website up on the big screen, I realized that some of my color choices were not strategic enough. I leaned more heavily on the red that  used in the beginning of my presentation to delineate the sections on providing global and gender context. I then made a point of color coordinationg the natural disaster section a teal color and the water quality/scarcity section a light blue. I used these colors in section headers, visualizations, and as highlighting colors in large bodies of text. I also used these colors int he final call to action section. Increasing their use is more effective at helping the audience differentiate between the two topics.

### Audience Refinement

In Part 2 I was still slightly confused as to who exactly my audience would be. I had decided that it was a Western/Global North audience that needed to increase their awareness on the Global North-South climate and gender divide. However, as I worked I began to write my text to explain the datasets and articles that I had read. This inadvertently helped me focus on the US student population in Global North countries. Once I actively realized this, I was able to give further context on this complex intersection of issues such that a student with no context could read through the page and still understand what I was talking about. This is also why I chose Los Angeles and Chicago as my population comparisons in the hook of my website, choosing to focus on US cities with which youth would likely be familiar.

### Focus on both Water and Natural Disaster Issues

Instead of focusing in on water issues as I had previously stated in Part 2, I decided to keep my scope wider and allow for both water and natrual disasters to be analyzed within an equity scope. This was not only because I had already made visualizations that I wanted to use, but because I had some trouble finding enough data to make one single focus compelling enough. To make my website more robust was also a good decision logically. From my perspective, analyzing a single climate change related issue and definitively stating, "Women have it worse!" could be seen as misleading. By covering at least two climate change topics, it is more clear to the audience that women have it worse when it comes to climate change across climate issues. FOcusing on two issues instead of one or three allows for the audience's attention to be focused enough (two is better than three) and helps strengthen the claim that climate change is worse for women across the board (two is better than one). 

### New Visualizations

In addition to the Part 2 visualizations I had already made (the populations and mortality rate bar chart, the ND GAIN world map, the 80% statistic infographic, the natural disaster pie charts, the water quality boxplot), I decided to create a few more data visualizations. I did not realize the gaps in my logic until I was designing them within Shorthand. To fill in these gaps, I made the following visualizations:

#### Pie Chart Refinement
I recreated my Infogram pie chart sin Flourish so that they could be animated.

#### Global Carbon Emissions
Previously, I felt as if the fact that the Global South is bearing the climate change burden despite not contributing much to global carbon emissions was not obvious enough. To draw more direct focus to this topic, I decided to make a new graphic that would illustrate this point. I made the graphic a map so that it could easily be compared agains tht eprevious map, which is also why I put them relatively close together. I originally thought of putting them side-by-side so that they could be even more easily compared, but this did not allow of the text I wanted associated with each graphic to be visible at the same time. Ultimately, I wanted the text association more than the side-by-side map association.

#### Linking Climate and Gender

Similar tot he above new graphic, I decided that burying my argument inside text was not as compelling as crafting a visualization. To this end, I made a scatterplot correlating cmlimate vulnerability with gender inequity, helping to uderscore that these two concepts are closely intertwined. I used blue because that is the main color pallete of my shorthand page; I decided against red because it seemed a feww steps ahead of the rest of the context section, which is red-coded.

### Additional Source Text Explanations

WHen I completed Part 2, a lot of my narrative text was not finalized. Now that the website is finished, I can confidently say that the narrative text bodies add a lot of value to my page. Though it is less compelling at the front of a classroom, I think that the bodies of text add a lot of necessary context that will give the page longevity when viewed online from personal computers. This includes going into detail on what exactly the ND GAIN data means as well as US AID's Triple Nexus score.

### Improved Citations

I replaced the in-text citations with footnote style Chicago citations. Per the professor's guidance and me thinking about it for more than two seconds, it makes sense to ignore in-text citations. They are not likely to be navigated by the target audience, and if anything they distract from teh visual design I worked so hard on. The hyperlinked sources and superscripts were removed from the body of the Shorthand webpage. Instead, the final Source section is alphabetized, not chrnonological.
