# Final Project: Part 1

## Summary:

This project aims to highlight the unequal burden of climate change along a gender divide. Women are more likely than men to suffer from the adverse effects of climate change, and there is very little data on non-binary individuals. Highlighting this divide helps target aid efforts and enforces existing conversations on the necessity of gender equity across societal sectors.


In this project, I will analyze available data and statistics to tell the story of how women are more likely to suffer from climate change. I will first use a wide scope to tell a global story, then hone in on those countries most vulnerable to climate change and the natural disasters women in those countries have been disproportionately affected by.

## Outline

Part 1: Climate Change will Increase Mortality Across the World
  -  Will visualize this statistic from [the V20 article](https://www.v-20.org/new-health-data-shows-unabated-climate-change-will-cause-3.4-million-deaths-per-year-by-century-end#:~:text=The%20Health%20Data%20Explorer%20outlines,million%20deaths%20would%20be%20avoided.) on COP27 findings: "Unabated climate change will cause 3.4 million deaths per year by the end of the Century"

Part 2: Focus on Climate Vulnerable Countries
  -  Countries most vulnerable to climate change
  -  Data set uses [Notre Dame GAIN Country Index](https://gain.nd.edu/our-work/country-index/rankings/)
  -  Will visualize using a world map, using gradations to signal countries with higher indexes. I don't have the colors to show a gradation in my sketch, but it will look something like hte following:

Part 3: Women Die More from Climate-Related Causes
  -  Global mortality rates - gender disparity between men and women
  -  2 data sets used from [The World Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/gender-statistics#), mortality from unsafe water & mortality from ambient/household air pollution
  -  Will visualize using two 1-axis data plots

Part 4: Connecting Gender & Climate Vulnerability
  -  Will use statistic of "80 of people displaced by climate change are women" from this [United Nations source](https://www.ohchr.org/en/stories/2022/07/climate-change-exacerbates-violence-against-women-and-girls#:~:text=Related&text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%2080,High%20Commissioner%20for%20Human%20Rights.)

  -  Next, will use data made available from [this website](https://genderandenvironment.org/triple-nexus/) which is in a [USAID report](https://portals.iucn.org/union/sites/union/files/doc/iucn-agent-triple-nexus-research-report-final.pdf) starting on page 122
  -  Will use "average gender equity" and "average climate vulnerability" data from the aforementioned resource. This will be displayed by scatterplot, with the aforementioned data on each axis. The resulting scatterplot will have a trend line with a slope of approximately 0.5, indicating that countries with low gender equity are also very climate vulnerable. This will be displayed as a scatterplot with a trend line.
  -  Paired with this scatterplot will be a table displaying the 10 lowest indexes of gender equity (color coded as yellow in both scatterplot and table) and climate vulnerability (color coded as blue in both scatterplot and table).

Part 5: Call to Action
  -  What the audience can do to help international organizations supporting women in vulnerable countries (e.g. unwomen, etc)
